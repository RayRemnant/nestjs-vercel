# NestJS Vercel Starter

A minimal and production-ready starter template to deploy **NestJS** on **Vercel**.

This project was bootstrapped using `nest new`, and adapted to work seamlessly with **Vercel’s serverless architecture** by building and serving the app from the `/api` directory. No need to tweak the configuration on Vercel, `vercel.json` will handle this.

> ✅ Great for quick deployments, serverless APIs, or testing NestJS on Vercel.

## 🛠️ Adapting Your Own NestJS Project

2. **Run the setup script**  
   Use the `script.js` included in this repo by running `node script.js`, it will automatically configure everything for you.  
   ⚠️ _Make sure to commit or back up your changes before running the script!_

## 📦 Deployment Strategy

Vercel expects your backend code to live in the `/api` folder and be exportable as serverless functions.

To support this:

- The build process compiles the NestJS app into `/api`
- Vercel picks up each entry point and deploys it as an independent serverless function
- This setup enables fast, scalable, and low-maintenance backend deployments

## 🧪 Getting Started Locally

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# build the app into /api
npm run build

# install the vercel cli globally
npm install -g vercel

# deploy on vercel
vercel deploy
```
